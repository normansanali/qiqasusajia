In February, the three actors were ecstatic to reunite for the FX comedy’s <a href=#>third season</a> premiere and met with Vulture for a roundtable about their work on the show.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cju2v2xdr00133a67k82h2ui3@published data-word-count=111>After three seasons of playing siblings, it’s clear the three actors have bonded. Over the course of an hour-long conversation at FX headquarters in Los Angeles, they teased, complimented, and boosted one another, and reminisced about working together like the best of besties. They laughed and teared up discussing what their first big roles have meant to them, and revealed that they are nothing like their TV characters. Mikey, 19, who lives in L.A.’s Valley has none of Max’s self-centeredness; Hannah, 15, who lives in Birmingham, Alabama, is softer and more sensitive than Frankie; and 12-year-old Olivia is a total ham who lives in Long Island and is savvier than Duke.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cju2v2xdp00123a67kak0p0a4@published data-word-count=82>Co-created by <a href=#>Pamela Adlon</a>, who directed the entire third season and stars as the girls’ mother, Sam Fox, Better Things depicts life in a single working mother household like no other TV show does. Mikey, Hannah, and Olivia view Adlon as their role model and inspiration, and say they’re grateful for the opportunities the show has afforded them — namely, working with a monkey, learning choreography, and traveling to Canada together. The following is an edited and condensed version of our conversation.</p><span class=divider-border></span><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cju2v2zw2003z3a67mo88gn1m@published data-word-count=70><strong>I would love to hear how the three of you got into acting.</strong><br>Olivia:<strong> </strong>When I was 2, I was in my parents’ room and I was watching this Gap Kids commercial.

I hate it. I will hurt you. So I was like, Please don’t tickle me. And then Pamela swooped in, sat me on the bench, and then untied my blindfold. All of a sudden, I see these guys standing on the stage. I was like, What is going on here? And you started doing the dance. A part of me was wondering, Am I going to have to learn this dance? And then I was like, Oh, no, this is a surprise. And they did this incredible dance. It was like the best present I could have received. And it wasn’t even for me.
